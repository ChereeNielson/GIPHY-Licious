# GIPHY-Licious! #

Get gifs from your favorite TV Sitcoms at the click of a button! :heart: :tv: :heart:

## What this project does ## 

This project makes use of the [`GIPHY API`](https://developers.giphy.com/) to access GIPHY's enormous gif library. `jQuery` is used to display gifs in the `DOM`. Buttons are created with a `for loop`, gifs and their static images are toggled with an `if-statement`, and user input is collected with `on-click functions`.

## How users can get started with this project ## 

1. **[Open GIPHY-Licious](https://chereenielson.github.io/GIPHY-Licious/)**
    - Preloaded buttons are provided with some of <i>my</i> favorite TV Sitcoms. Now add <i>your</i> favorite TV Sitcoms to generate a new button!

2. **Load some gifs**
    - With just a click of a button, 10 images from the GIPHY library will load on the page below. 

3. **Animate the gifs**
    - Click any still image to animate the gif! Click the gif again to still the image.

4. **Start over with a new set of gifs**
    - Simply refresh the page to remove any new buttons added and clear out the gifs.
